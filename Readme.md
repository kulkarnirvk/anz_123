## Simplification Engineering Test

This virtual machine image contains an extremely basic web application which does 2 basic database operations of creating users in a database and reading from the database and displaying information. 

The stack for this web application is LAMP and the image is provided by bitnami.

###  Base Challenge

Your goal is showcase 2 methods of moving this application to public cloud:
1. Lift and shift - Rehost this application onto either AWS (EC2) or GCP(Compute Engine)
2. Replatform / Rearchitect this solution to be cloud native with no IaaS components

Relevant Technical Information
- This has been tested to run on VirtualBox, consider that your  on-prem environment.
- VM login details:
    ```
    Username: bitnami
    Password: bitnami
    ```
- Database is MariaDB
- Database credentials - purposely not provided
- SSH is enabled on the VM
- Webroot can be accesed through the `htdocs` symlink in the home directory

Tips
- Focus on the task at hand, not on the application itself
